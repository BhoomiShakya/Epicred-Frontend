## 🧠 Storage Behavior

### `localStorage` vs `sessionStorage`

- `localStorage`: Data persists even after closing the tab/browser.
- `sessionStorage`: Data is cleared when the tab is closed.

> ⚠️ Neither of them expires automatically. You can implement manual expiry as shown below:

### ✅ Custom Expiry Example

```ts
// Set data with expiry
export const setWithExpiry = (key: string, value: any, ttl: number) => {
  const now = new Date();
  const item = {
    value,
    expiry: now.getTime() + ttl, // Time to live in ms
  };
  localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(item));
};

// Get data with expiry check
export const getWithExpiry = (key: string) => {
  const itemStr = localStorage.getItem(key);
  if (!itemStr) return null;

  const item = JSON.parse(itemStr);
  if (new Date().getTime() > item.expiry) {
    localStorage.removeItem(key);
    return null;
  }

  return item.value;
};
```
